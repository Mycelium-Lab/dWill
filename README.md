## <b><a href="https://dwill.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dWill</a></b> - the first fully decentralized way to bequeath your cryptocurrency.
<br>

### <b>dWill</b> - the first decentralized non-custodial inheritance protocol. With dWill, you can bequeath any ERC-20 tokens from your cryptocurrency wallet to the trusted wallets of your family and friends (or, for example, to your reserve wallet)

<br>

### Thanks to smart contract technology, <b>dWill</b> works completely in a decentralized way, reliably and autonomously. No one (no one at all, not even the project team) will have access to the funds you bequeathed.
